How INNER JOIN Works
An INNER JOIN in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables. If there is no match, the result is not included in the output.


SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
Explanation
SELECT columns: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.
FROM table1: The primary table from which you want to retrieve data.
INNER JOIN table2: The secondary table you are joining with the primary table.
ON table1.column = table2.column: The condition that specifies the relationship between columns of the two tables.
Example with User and Tree Tables
Let's use your User and Tree tables to demonstrate how INNER JOIN works.

Tables
User Table

id	name	created_on
1	Ash	2024-05-01 00:00:00
2	Misty	2024-05-02 00:00:00
3	Brock	2024-05-03 00:00:00
Tree Table

id	species	age	height	watered_on	planted_on	user_id
1	Oak	1	3	2024-05-01 00:00:00	2024-05-01 00:00:00	1
2	Maple	2	4	2024-05-01 00:00:00	2024-05-01 00:00:00	1
3	Pine	3	5	2024-05-01 00:00:00	2024-05-01 00:00:00	2
Inner Join Query
Suppose we want to list all users along with the species of trees they have planted.

sql
Copy code
SELECT User.name, Tree.species
FROM User
INNER JOIN Tree ON User.id = Tree.user_id;
Result
name	species
Ash	Oak
Ash	Maple
Misty	Pine
